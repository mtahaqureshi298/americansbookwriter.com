                    <h4>Can’t Decide Between Mystery and Romance? The Reluctant Courier is the Solution!</h4>
                    <p>Falling in love with the person who saved your life and having it reciprocated is not an
                        experience many of us have had, but the same can’t be said about Patricia Anne Albertson,
                        one of the characters in Rick Kauffman’s third and latest book, Exiled: The Life and Times
                        of Kevin Jamison.</p>
                    <p>Patricia is the love interest of Kevin Jamison, introduced much later in the book. While
                        running some errands on his day off, Kevin discovers her unconscious and injured. Waking up,
                        she discovers that she has lost all memories of her life before waking up in Kevin’s cabin.
                        She soon starts remembering things and feels touched when she realizes that Kevin has been
                        taking care of her kids.</p>
                    <p>Being cheated on by her husband and having nowhere to go, she extends her stay at Kevin’s
                        place —calling it home, even. With each other as their only connection to the world around
                        them, they develop feelings for each other. As time passes, so does their relationship grow
                        into something more; by being there and taking care of each other and being the other’s
                        support during the hard times, Patricia and Kevin become each other's, even if their bond
                        was created through loss and grief.</p>
                    <p>And as is the nature of human relationships, misunderstandings arise, and the seed of doubt
                        grows into something ugly. But it is through understanding and the time they have spent
                        together that they get through it. Patricia becomes the pillar that Kevin needs when he
                        becomes a suspect in a murder and sexual assault case by the city police of his county,
                        Idaho.</p>
                    <p>Kauffman writes the relation between Kevin and Patricia in such a relatable manner that the
                        readers can't help but get attached to them and feel like getting into a relation of their
                        own. Though Exiled is not a romance story but the elements are mixed in so well with the
                        adventurous and mystery vibe of the book.</p>
