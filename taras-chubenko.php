                    <h4>Knowing Yourself, leads to Knowing God</h4>

                    <p>Rt. Rev. Dr. Taras Chubenko’s book, “Connecting to God: A Journey Over 50 Years,” explores
                        the significance of introspection and self-discovery in the search for spiritual
                        enlightenment. The chapter emphasizes that the first step towards discovering our divinity
                        is knowing ourselves better, and developing a stronger connection to God by understanding
                        our own beliefs, values, and behaviors.</p>
                    <p>The importance of introspection cannot be overstated when it comes to spiritual growth.
                        However, many people are unaware of how their upbringing, social conditioning, and cultural
                        conventions have shaped their worldview. Therefore, understanding our early exposure to
                        media, culture, and social conditioning can help us identify our biases and beliefs that may
                        be hindering our spiritual growth.</p>
                    <p>The book also highlights the importance of learning from both positive and negative life
                        experiences to deepen our understanding of ourselves and our relationship with God. Through
                        introspection, we can gain insights into our beliefs and connect with our inner divinity.
                    </p>
                    <p>Learning about oneself is a crucial part of spiritual growth. By being open to
                        self-examination and being truthful about our ideas, emotions, and worldviews, we can better
                        known ourselves and connect with our inner divinity. To remove obstacles and become closer
                        to God, we must first accept ourselves as we truly are.</p>
                    <p>Connecting to God" shows how important self-reflection, self-discovery, and self-acceptance
                        are for spiritual growth. By understanding ourselves better, we can develop a deeper
                        connection to God, and live a more fulfilling life.</p>
