                    <h4>An Olive Branch in Her Time of Need God’s Grace is Sufficient for Me</h4>
                    <p>God’s Grace is Sufficient for Me is a book that tells the journey of Gladys H. Griffin as she
                        suffered through five illnesses at the same time during the year 2020, and it is only
                        because God bestowed his grace on her that she made it alive and well to stand where she is
                        today. As a mother, widow, grandmother, and retired university professor, Gladys now spends
                        her time developing her hobby of writing into a more professional thing as she publishes her
                        first book, God’s Grace is Sufficient for Me, and works on her second manuscript, Stepping
                        Out in Grace.</p>
                    <p>Gladys talks about how the only reason our lives are not condemned is through God’s grace,
                        and it is because of His blessings and His blessings alone that we can achieve true
                        happiness in this life and the one after. The only way to be successful in life is if we
                        follow the word of God in the Bible—both the Old and New Testaments—and live life
                        accordingly. Gladys, in her book, discusses how merciful and beneficent God is, and even if
                        we turn to him once in our time of need, that would be enough to invite all his blessings
                        into our lives.</p>
                    <p>To walk the path of righteousness that God intended for us to do in order for us to live
                        peaceful and content lives, we must take what He says to heart and be patient. For hardships
                        —no matter how hopeless and bleak they seem—can only be endured through the strength that
                        comes from believing in God and everything we do outside of it; all the struggles and
                        efforts are worthless if not done in the name of God.</p>
                    <p>Of course, it can be assumed that the only reason that we are bestowed by the grace of God is
                        because of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice for us and that our good or bad deeds have no effect on
                        this gift from God. Gladys discusses her viewpoints and opinions on the topic in depth in
                        her book, God’s Grace is Sufficient for Me, now available on Amazon and the official
                        website.</p>
