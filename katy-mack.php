                    <h4>The Outsider’s Perspective Logan</h4>
                    <p>Books with the themes of trauma, recovery, and loss are often very difficult to read, not in

                        terms of reading comprehension but more so because of their heavy nature. But there’s one
                        book that breaks that routine and keeps the mood as balanced as it could be while talking
                        about such topics: Logan by Katy Mack. The book’s plot revolves around the premises of
                        addiction, recovery, and redemption but also adds some flavor with the help of romance and
                        friendship.</p>
                    <p>High school is the time to experience new things, get to know new people, and give love a
                        chance. Our protagonists do the same thing every teenager does —fall in love. The problem
                        lies in managing a relationship while also following their dreams. It’s a tough choice that
                        Mikayla and Logan have to make, and it does take them on separate roads, but eventually
                        things work out.</p>
                    <p>The addiction to drugs and other unhealthy coping mechanisms comes in when Logan gets injured
                        in the war, losing his chance at a career as a professional football player. Having had
                        tunnel vision to achieve that goal, once lost, he spirals. The time it takes him to get back
                        up on his feet is long and tedious, and he loses much more along the way to recovery.</p>
                    <p>The realism of him making bad decisions, pushing people away, and isolating himself comes
                        from all the research Mack did to express her empathy for people going through the process.
                        Having never experienced addiction before, she wanted people to know how difficult and
                        non-linear the journey is. Maybe this outside perspective is what keeps the book from
                        getting too dark and heavy, as it has given us hope for a better future all along.</p>
