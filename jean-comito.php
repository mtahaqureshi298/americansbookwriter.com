                    <h4>From Stay-at-Home Mom to Published Author: The Inspiring Journey of Jean Comito Gurny</h4>
                    <p>There have been many highs and lows in Jean Comito Gurny's life, but her love of writing has
                        never wavered. Jean, the youngest of three girls, was up in the Bronx, New York, and was
                        taught the importance of being trustworthy, open, spiritual, and kind. She was married when
                        she was just 19 to her high school love, and they had two children, Christopher and
                        Michelle. Jean, a stay-at-home parent, cherished being there for her kids at every turning
                        point in their lives.</p>
                    <p>Jean had a lifelong interest in writing, but she had to put her ambition on wait while she
                        dealt with other priorities. However, as her offspring matured, so did she. She finished her
                        education and picked up the reins of her literary career. After almost 45 years of marriage,
                        her husband died suddenly, leaving Jean to go on an unfamiliar path alone. But writing
                        brought her comfort, and with her newfound independence she could devote herself to her
                        calling.</p>
                    <p>As of now, Jean Comito Gurny has Book 1 of "The Adventure of Willow the Penguin" released.
                        She thanks her husband, parents, and all the mothers and fathers who will read her book for
                        being "angels" in her life. Her life is an uplifting tale of sticking to your goals despite
                        setbacks and never giving up on your objectives.</p>
