                        this industry also saw its own evolution. Though people at first hesitated about investing
                        in land and building structures, that soon changed as more and more awareness spread and it
                        became a common norm.</p>
                    <p>As people's interest in the industry increased, so did their attempts to use underhanded
                        tricks to gain more profit, and with that, once again, came the fear of losing their wealth.
